•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially considering your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One of the techniques I’ve learned throughout my time studying computer science is to consider a project’s end goal and then break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Each step becomes an efficient block of the project that I can test individually , ensuring that when combined, they build up to the final solution. This approach directly supports writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In Project One I created a CRUD Python module that handled all the database operations. By keeping the database logic in its own module, the dashboard code in Project Two focused on user interface and interaction, while the CRUD class acted as a single well-defined connection point to the database. Formatting the overall project this way made the project adaptable, since the same CRUD class can be reused for a different dashboard or web API without rewriting the database logic. This modular approach helps ensure that my programs remain organized and flexible enough to meet new requirements in the future.  


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I start with requirements and translate them into data and models. For Grazioso Salvare, that meant identifying key fields and filters needed for the rescue categories, then mapping them to MongoDB queries. I built the UI iteratively, first the table and radio buttons, following by the map and pie chart, and finally the highlighting behavior. I also added client-friendly features like sorting, paging, and filtering to heighten usability. Compared to my past projects, this project required more full-stack thinking. In the future I’ll have to consider design into my thought process during the planning phase.  


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists take real-world problems and turn them into practical, data-driven solutions. In this project, the dashboard makes it easier for Grazioso Salvare to work with animal data that might otherwise feel overwhelming or inconsistent. Instead of digging through long spreadsheets, staff can quickly filter for dogs that fit their needs based on age, sex ,or breed, see immediately which breeds are most common, and even locate animals on a map. This enhanced productivity and helps match the right dog to the right kind of training. This kind of tool matters because it gives the organization more time to focus on its mission and less time wrestling with raw data. The Dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare save time, improve accuracy, and stay focused on training and deploying animals where they’re needed most.
